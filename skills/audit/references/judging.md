# Finding Validation

Each finding passes a false-positive gate, then gets a confidence score (how certain you are it is real).

## FP Gate

Every finding must pass all three checks. If any check fails, drop the finding — do not score or report it.

1. You can trace a concrete attack path: caller → function call → state change → loss/impact.
2. The entry point is reachable by the attacker (check modifiers, `msg.sender` guards, `onlyOwner`, access control).
3. No existing guard already prevents the attack (`require`, `if`-revert, reentrancy lock, allowance check, etc.).

## Confidence Score

Confidence measures certainty that the finding is real and exploitable — not how severe it is. Every finding that passes the FP gate starts at **100**.

**Deductions (apply all that fit):**

- Privileged caller required (owner, admin, multisig, governance) → **-25**.
- Attack path is partial (general idea is sound but cannot write exact caller → call → state change → outcome) → **-25**.
- Impact is self-contained (only affects the attacker's own funds, no spillover to other users) → **-15**.

Confidence indicator: 🔴 above 90 · 🟡 75–90 · 🔵 below 75.

Findings below the confidence threshold (default 75) are still included in the report table but do not get a **Fix** section — description only.

## Do Not Report

- Anything a linter, compiler, or seasoned developer would dismiss — INFO-level notes, gas micro-optimizations, naming, NatSpec, redundant comments.
- Owner/admin can set fees, parameters, or pause — these are by-design privileges, not vulnerabilities.
- Missing event emissions or insufficient logging.
- Centralization observations without a concrete exploit path (e.g., "owner could rug" with no specific mechanism beyond trust assumptions).
- Theoretical issues requiring implausible preconditions (e.g., compromised compiler, corrupt block producer, >50% token supply held by attacker).
