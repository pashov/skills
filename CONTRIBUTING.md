# Contributing to Pashov Audit Group Skills

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes — attack vectors, agent prompts, report formatting, or documentation.
3. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main` before opening a PR.
4. Do not edit `VERSION` — it is bumped automatically on merge via CI.
5. Fill in the PR template. A maintainer will review within 5 business days.

### PR checklist

- [ ] No API keys, tokens, or sensitive data
- [ ] No fabricated examples — outputs must reflect real model responses
- [ ] Skill works with Claude Code CLI, VS Code, and Cursor

## What to Contribute

- **Attack vectors** — add new vectors to `solidity-auditor/references/attack-vectors/attack-vectors.md` following the existing `**D:**` / `**FP:**` format.
- **Agent prompts** — improve triage accuracy, reduce false positives, tighten output format.
- **Report formatting** — improve the output structure or fix template issues.
- **Bug fixes** — if the skill produces incorrect output, open an issue or PR with a fix.

## Reporting Bugs

Use the [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) issue template and include:

- Which skill is affected and how you invoked it.
- The Claude model used (e.g., claude-sonnet-4-6).
